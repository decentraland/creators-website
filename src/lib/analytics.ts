// Events land in the SAME Segment source as the legacy builder, and reuse its event names wherever a
// flow exists there, so old UI and new UI are comparable. Every event carries `source` to tell them
// apart — legacy builder sends none, so an absent `source` is the legacy app. `source` is therefore a
// reserved prop name: no event may pass its own.
//
// Nothing here is user-facing, so the copy/i18n rules don't apply. Never emit PII or secrets; wallet
// addresses are pseudonymous public ids and are allowed.
